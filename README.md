# Wobot.AI-Hardhat-Detection-Challenge
Wobot.AI has given me a series of challenges whose main idea was to :
1)Stage 1: Use their PASCAL VOC data and train in for hardhat and head detection using YOLOv4 by changing VOC dataset to .txt format.
2)Stage 2: If a hardhat has been detected change the color of the bounding box into the color of hardhat.
3)Stage 3: Test it on their test datset and submit the result in PASCAL VOC format files.
